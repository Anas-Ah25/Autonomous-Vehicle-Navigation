# 🚗 Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation

This project provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)** to visualize and compare different pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, **IDS**, and **Simulated Annealing**. 🎯 The GUI enables users to select an algorithm, observe its step-by-step execution, and analyze its performance.

## 🚀 How It Works
The project consists of the following key steps:
1. **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose from different algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, IDS, Gready, A*, Hill Climbing, or Simulated Annealing) via the GUI.
2. **Pathfinding Process**: Once an algorithm is selected, the program runs the chosen pathfinding algorithm on a grid. The grid is displayed in real-time, and the algorithm's progress is visualized as it explores nodes.
3. **Output**: Once the algorithm completes, the final path and explored nodes are displayed as images or videos.
4. **Analytics**: The performance metrics like execution time and memory usage are displayed to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
